### Organization
* ***Data*** Raw and processed data files are contained in the 'data/' folder. Data from the social experiment are in the 'social' subfolder, and data for the non-social experiment are in the 'non_social' folder. Pilot data are in the 'social_pilot' folder. The 'combined' folder contains the processed data from both the social and nonsocial experiments, combined into a single data file. The participant log includes details on each participant, along with contemporaneous notes on the testing session.
* ***Analysis*** 'analysis_code/' contains IPython notebooks showing the data analysis and simulations included in the manuscript, as well as the Stan models and related scripts ('analysis_code/stan'). Each model is sampled by its matching 'sample_*.py' script.  
* ***Task Code*** The PsychoPy task scripts and stimuli are in the 'task_code/' folder. Participants in the social experiment completed 'infer_design1.py' and participants in the nonsocial experiment completed 'infer_design1_no_eyetracking.py.' (Participants in the social group underwent eye tracking to pilot a different study.) Item pairs were generated randomly by the 'pair_generator.py' script, and underlying choices for the practice block were generated by the 'inference_practice_choice_generator.py' script. These pairs and choices were kept the same for all non-pilot participants.
